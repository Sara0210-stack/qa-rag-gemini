This project presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering (QA) Bot, designed to provide accurate and context-aware responses using business-related documents. It integrates the Google Gemini API for generative responses and Pinecone for efficient vector-based document retrieval, orchestrated with the help of LangChain.
